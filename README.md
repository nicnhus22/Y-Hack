Y-Hack - AudBox
======

Y-Hack project that I did with 3 other people from my school.

It is a reverse engineering app that creates a music sheet out of a .wav file.
I personally did all the layout, I created the 3D cube, managed the transitions and the Ajax requests. I also worked on the Dropbox API with PHP(...).
The other team members worked on the Mathematica API and on Matlab to generate an xml corresponding to the differents notes that are in the .wav file.

This version uploads a file to the server, then authenticates the user to his Dropbox account, creates a folder Baux to store the wav file. However, the music sheet generated is just an example, we only had 20 hours to do that.
